Hello, we are Hackers of SWJTU.

The Github organization **Hack Swjtu** is a opensource community. We want to make some network tools, browser plugin, web crawler, script and some web page to help everyone to work. In the future, we want to make some groups to take part in Hackathon competition in every places.

Now we had created two projects as following:

* **[HaRunGo](https://github.com/HackSwjtu/HackRunningGo-SC)**: HaRunGo can help you running in the school on *The School of Sport World*. We sincerely hope that the school software technology is getting better and better.
* **[HackSwjtuXZ](https://github.com/HackSwjtu/HackSwjtuXZ)**: HackSwjtuXZ can help you stay online to watch politics course web video all the time until the hours you want.

Now, we want someone to join us to make a better school. 

If you can programme (Front-end , Android, iOS, Algorithm, Web Crawler and so on), we want you. If you are interested, please send a email to `andy@hackswjtu.com`.
