## What do you think of Hackers？

<p>      Maybe in many people's minds, hackers are those who want to hack others' computers and they just do it. We are indeed hackers，but unlike other hackers, we don't make others' computers break down. And just on the opposite, we are supposed to help students in SWJTU. To be honest, Hack Swjtu is an excellent team, better than any teams I have ever seen.
##  What have we done?
<p>		In Swjtu, everybody knows there is an APP that wasting our time named *Running World on Campus*. So, we just take some actions and it is not a problem any more. If you are interested in how we make it,you can clip(https://hackswjtu.github.io/Running-or-Safe/).
## And now
<p>		we are doing something more helpful for you students in SWJTU, for example, if you do not know where to find the charts you need, then you can visit our website **HiSwjtu**; if you do not know how much left in your ID card, then you can visit **HiSwjtu**... In order to save time in searching,we will make the information you may need easier to touch. There is a wish in our minds that makes everyone understand that what you need to do is just to visit **HiSwjtu**, whenever and wherever you have difficulties.
